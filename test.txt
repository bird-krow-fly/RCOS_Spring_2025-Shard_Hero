Hard x and y limits for camera movement.

Camera is sibling node of character (maybe), managed by game manager script.

Anytime character is touching floor, save the relative y location. 

If jumps, camera only follows character if it passes a threshold of saved location +- 100 (or some value). 

Will follow at character velocity.
